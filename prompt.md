dont add host event there, add just below this text Discover & Book Events...

remove images from the categories too

add more categories which u think can fit in

now when i click on host event a page comes up - make it in center and ask the category too so that we can filter it out and city also ask

now add some balance and while registering and creating an event we can set a price and if registered that amount will be deducted

now for the concurrent part... modify to prevent race conditions and overbooking... MongoDB atomic conditional update... Provide corrected Go code

now do a test of concurrency - make an event of capacity 1 then do 50 attempts at that 1 event slot concurrently... i wana see output

show me on terminal the output likes 50 went and 1 got done and 49 failed - i wanna see

now i want to u create 3 files - .gitignore, prompt.md which just has all my prompts and nothing else, start.md - my concureny start of using goroutine and atomic db call
